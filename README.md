# Nashville's Mentor Night Site

This is the source code for our group's upcoming public Web site. Development mostly happens in the `/src` folder, while the build files are in the `/docs` folder. Old, archived progress for this project is located [at this repository](https://github.com/nashvillefcc/nashvillefcc2020website). Since we moved to Gatsby, all progress has been logged on this repository.

## Built With

- [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)

## Getting Started

From the command line, you can run:

- `npm install` - Installs dependencies for this project.
- `npm run develop` - Runs the site in development mode, allows for live editing.
- `npm run build` - Builds the site for deployment in `public` folder, which we ignore with git.
- `npm run analyze` - See what ESLint and Prettier can fix.
- `npm run fix` - Run Prettier and ESLint with the `--fix` option.
- `npm run test` - TODO: https://gatsby.dev/unit-testing\

If you are using VS Code, we have recommended extensions listed in the `mentor-night-site.code-workspace` file. VS Code will automatically detect that list and prompt you to install.
