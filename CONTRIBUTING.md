# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please notify us first before assigning yourself to the ticket. We can be contacted via Discord or GitHub. See the [task board](https://github.com/nashvillefcc/mentor-night-site/projects/1) for a list of features and bugs we're working on.

## Git Conventions

Development to the `master` branch is locked. Code changes should be introduced through feature branches and reviewed through a pull request. A short primer can be found here: [https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/).

We will not be enforcing a naming convention for branch names, but please keep them descriptive or related to the feature that you worked on.

## Review Process

When an issue is complete and ready for review, please create a pull request from your feature branch to our `develop` branch. Each issue should correspond to a single pull request. We require at least 2 approvals from other developers, and 1 of those must be a senior developer.

You can use the following template for your PR description:

```txt
Resolves #[Replace with issue number]
# Description of Changes
[Replace with description of what you changed or introduced. Developers should be able to read this and the Files Changed section and have a good understanding of what this PR is about.]

## How Can I Test This?
[Replace with instructions for another developer to quickly test our your new code. If they need to copy/paste code from here to get it working, provide the code below in brackets.]
```

Once the pull request is generated and ready for review, please notify the team on Discord.

## Code of Conduct

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

### Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

### Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

### Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.
